# GENERAL INFORMATION
The canvas element is a part of HTML5 which is used for creating 2D shapes and bitmap images via scripting (usually JavaScript). For instance, it can be used for drawing graphs, creating collages, simple animations or even games. The Canvas element is also used by WebGL for hardware-accelerating of 3D graphics.
