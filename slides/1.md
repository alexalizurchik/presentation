## WHAT IS CANVAS?

The canvas element is: "...a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas, which can be used for rendering graphs, game graphics, art, or other visual images on the fly."

The Canvas element is also used by WebGL for hardware-accelerating of 3D graphics.
Note: The CANVAS is a part of HTML5 which lets you draw graphs, graphics, games, art, and other visuals right on the web page in real time.
