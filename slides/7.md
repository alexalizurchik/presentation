## OFFSCREEN CANVAS
One of the latest features of canvas is offscreen canvas. Its interface provides a canvas that can be rendered off screen. It greatly accelerates the rendering of graphics on the page through the use of multithreading processors because it helps to hide access to canvas from the main thread. It is available in both the window and worker contexts.
