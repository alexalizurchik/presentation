## CONS
* Overloads the processor and RAM because of garbage collector limitation;
* Poor performance with high resolution;
* Ability to create special "trackers", which are called Canvas Fingerprinting, on the pages, to track users on
the network.
Note: At the same time the are a few cons:
    Overloads the processor and RAM because of garmage collector limitation;
    Poor performance with high resolution;
    Ability to create special "trackers"on the pages, to track users on the network.
    Inspite of this cons the main reason to use the CANVAS is the easiest way to turn a plain web page into a 
    dynamic web application and then convert that application into a mobile app for use on smartphones and tablets.
